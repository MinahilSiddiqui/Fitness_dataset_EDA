# Fitness Data Analysis and EDA:

This Jupyter Notebook performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the dataset used in this project. It provides data preprocessing, statistical insights, and visualizations to better understand the data.
---

### Key Objectives:

1. **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, duplicates, and incorrect data types.
2. **Descriptive Statistics**: Summarize key metrics like mean, median, and standard deviation.
3. **Visualizations**: Generate plots including histograms, scatterplots, boxplots, and heatmaps for insights.
4. **Feature Engineering**: Create new variables to enhance data modeling potential.
5. **Correlation Analysis**: Identify relationships between features.

## Dataset Details

Replace the following path in the notebook to load your specific dataset:

```python
data = pd.read_csv("path_to_dataset.csv")
```

### Assumptions about the dataset:

* The dataset contains numerical and categorical columns.
* Missing values are present and need handling.
* The data needs preprocessing for visualization and analysis.

## Usage

1. Open the notebook in Jupyter:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook fitnessAnalysis.ipynb
   ```

2. Run cells sequentially to perform the analysis.
